I didn't know in python, in list if assigned to another
on change of another list, previous list is affected. 

This same stuff doesn't happen with other data primitive data types. Slicing previous list from start to end for eg
a = [1,2,3]
b = a # b is now pointing to same address as a so, on change of b a will be affected.

but if 
c = a[:]
c is not pointing to a but rather taking all the contents of a so, change on c doesn't affect a. so from now on if i have to copy a list, i'll use this following method instead of assigning one list to another and risking manipulation.
